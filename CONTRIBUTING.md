## Code Contributions

Please fork the project, make the changes, testing where possible, then raise a pull request. If you are unfamiliar with this process [this gist](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962) is a good starting point.

To get started contributing code, please look at issues tagged with `good first issue` or `help wanted` tags. Typically `good first issue` issues with be minor changes requiring a line or two of code change. `help wanted` issues will be a bit more involved than `good first issue` issues.
